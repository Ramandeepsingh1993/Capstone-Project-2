Impact Of Online And Offline Education On Student Performance And Engagement
Hybrid education has become a central focus in today's evolving learning environment. Online
education provides flexibility and accessibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace,
often enhancing participation in diverse and global settings. However, it may lack the direct,
interactive experiences found in o∆Øline education, where face-to-face engagement and
classroom dynamics can lead to deeper learning and stronger interpersonal skills.
